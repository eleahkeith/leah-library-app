--------brainstorm
-when you click on full list, takes over the whole page and header becomes small, no image but title still present
-use animation to push full list up and down
-add bottom menu like the fancy apps
when you first go to the page, checks if you are logged in 
    (how? check if auth token exists in local storage, if so direct to overview, if not to log in )
