# Leah's Library App

Leah's Library is a web app that allows the user to create/edit/delete bookshelves, and then add or remove books to each shelf. 

## Currently (updated 1/6/21)
- ~~adding loading state~~
- ~~adding authentication to allow for multiple users~~

## Why this app?

I am an avid reader, and I have struggled to find a simple, clean way to keep track of what I read. This app is not just a reading list, it's a way to categorize books for future reference (e.g. books recommended by friends, books I hear about on podcasts, all time favorites, books I want to re-read, etc).
